  <h1>I love you</h1>
  <p>I wish i had something better to give you than a dumbass website. i just want you to know that i love you. i never loved and i will never love like this.

  Solipsism is the belief that only your own mind is real, and everything else—other people and the world—might just be made up by you. 
If everything’s just in my mind, then I must admit… you’re definitely my favorite creation.

im sorry for the feet thingy aliynah, i feel ashamed of myself for it and i hope you can forgive me.

i love you. i say it so much because i just cant hold it in me, i have never wanted a person beside me more. please. stay beside me, my whole life.
i love you for what you are, you are, how you look, and how you talk, its all just. a fever dream to me still. to be around you is a gift and a blessing.
I love you. and even if you were just in my head, I’d still choose you every time. 
I love you. and even in my wildest daydreams, you’d still be my favorite.
I love you because even my imagination can’t compete with you.
  
  Aliynah you are so pretty its just. i already feel it in my stomache, its really that im just, deeply in love with you.
  im not sure if i upset you but, either way, i love you and i hope you get better. this wont be easy, shit between us will be annoying and ass sometimes
i just ask of you to be patient with me. i love you okay? you're something i dont want to lose, i dont even want to think about losing you.
 i think the better way to say this is. i WON'T lose you, ill try my best. </p>
