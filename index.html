      OF COURSE THATS NOT WHY IM IN LOVE WITH YOU.. BUT. its funny, me and you are 100% made for eachother, i wish i had more of you, your lips or cuddles with you at night. ONE DAY OKAY? im gonna work my ass off, everywhere, so you can come over and me and you can have a perfect life
      <p>Of course nothing goes according to plan in life.. which is scary. but. we wont get seperated. got it? i dont wanna hear none of that '' but the timezones..'', me and you do it despite the timezones because we're meant to be, i mean, thats atleast what i think.. <P>
